# AccuTool

## Introduction

A causal mutation conferring phenotypic variation and its tagging variant, detected in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), are related through a common founder effect. This relationship can be exploited to facilitate candidate gene identification by defining the set of mutations in strong association with the tagging variant. Our lab has created the AccuTool to enable researchers to perform this post-GWAS analysis without the need for any bioinformatic or computer programming knowledge.

## Description

The AccuTool is a web-based tool used to explore the landscape of association between a single genomic position (or phenotype) and whole genome sequence (WGS)-derived variant positions within a user-defined region of a chromosome. The tool calculates this association based on a panel of 775 genetically-diverse, publicly available resequenced soybean accessions. This measure of association (i.e. "Accuracy") between the tagging variant and any given WGS variant is the percentage of total lines with either the reference haplotype at these two positions, or any of the alternate haplotypes. Please see "Output" below for a brief description of the different Accuracy parameters, or the publication for a more in-depth description.
